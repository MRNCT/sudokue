sudokue is a sudoku app built with vue.js.  It's a playground for me to learn more about vue.js and advanced sudoku-solving techniques.

sudokue is alpha software and should not be used in production or professional sudoku environments.  It can currently solve intermediate level puzzles using a simple elimination strategy.
